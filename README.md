# CIPOPatentFees
The fees the Canadian Patent Office charges change every year. Fees arranged in a table by type and year. 

CIPO doesn't share this data as a table and you must use their website to find the correct fee. Even then website has errors in current and historical fees. This dataset is for calculation purposes such as creating cost estimates.
